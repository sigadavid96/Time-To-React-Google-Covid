Hi!

This is a project by Davidson, Stuti and Satish for the Practical Data Science (15-688) Project at Carnegie Mellon University.
Studied and Implemented the design in Spring 2022.

How can we measure public reaction to global events?

>Would look at time taken by people to react to events occurring across the globe - “Time to react”

>Understand the factors influencing ‘time to react’ for future events

>In this project, we focus on time to react for a current major event, COVID, across regions

Why is it important?

>Information on how quickly people are aware of events can be an essential tool for global organizations like WHO and the UN to take safety measures as soon as possible
